tackle(应对) the climate crisis

Current nuclear energy relies on fission(分裂)

with very little radioactivity(放射性)

confine hot plasma(等离子体) within a structure called a tokamak

help demonstrate whether fusion can be commercially viable(帮助证明核聚变是否能在商业上可行)

a notional(概念) start to operations

journeys fraught with difficulty

Nevertheless it's ticking off milestones on that path to demonstrating fusion at the commercial scale

the Joint European Torus(环形加速器)

Euratom treaty(欧洲原子能共同体条约)
