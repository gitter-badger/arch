```
a mix of complacency(自满)
career self-preservation
lack of Kotlin visibility

Java is getting better with each release
Kotlin is a hyped language with an unknown future
Kotlin is too complicated(复杂的)

===
Our team didn’t follow the typical Java playbook
we used Utterlyidle instead of Spring 
and embraced a Functional Programming approach with Totallylazy

Eventually, most of us were giving it a try

# [7-4]Economy

- Consume Less. Create More. It’s More Fun
  - @doc https://telegra.ph/Consume-Less-Create-More-Its-More-Fun-12-04

```
Big corporations use marketing to trick us into thinking 
that the solution to all our problems lies in buying more of their stuff

our problems are caused by overconsumption in the first place

be bombarded(炮轰) with ads for gym subscriptions or food supplements
protein powder(蛋白粉)
antidepressants(抗抑郁药)

Pills are never designed to be a permanent(永久) solution: 
they lose power over time and cause side effects 
that will in turn require more pills

Once you embark(踏上) on the endless journey of consumption,
you get stuck in a trap designed to make you miserable(悲惨) and corporations happy

Through evolution, Mother Nature has equipped us to efficiently cope with deficits(赤字) of resources, 
but it never prepared us for life in the relative abundance we have now.

obsolete(过时)
Through evolution
stopped evolving

live in megacities(特大城市)

Our bodies still accumulate excess(过剩) fat to prepare for harsh hungry winters that never come

cling to
This biological paradox(悖论)
it is also unsustainable(不可持续) in the long-term
Unlike corporate appetites
pristine(质朴) environment

As we keep destroying our own habitat(栖息地) in the eternal quest(永恒的追求) for economic growth, 
the number of diseases caused by pollution continues to rise

occupation
yachts(游艇)
expensive real estate(房地产)
strives for perfection(精益求精)

Back then, it was considered an occupation for nerds(书呆子)

We live in an era when the possibilities for human creativity are endless.

the self-destructive path

```
I want to have a personal life 
and not have to spend my nights reading up on some new flavour(口味) of *.js 
in fear that if I don't I would soon be made irrelevant(不相干)
```
